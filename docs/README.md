## Opening Statement
TcGraph is a modular framework for visual programming. TcGraph allows you to create a node-based editor directly in TwinCAT HMI. You can then define nodes which represent functions and function blocks, which can be used to draw programs which are executed live in realtime without needing to compile and download to TwinCAT.

## Getting started
Currently TcGraph is being developed in tandem with the Vision-Toolkit.  The repo and getting started instructions can be found [here...](https://github.com/TcGraph-Dev-Team/vision-toolkit)
